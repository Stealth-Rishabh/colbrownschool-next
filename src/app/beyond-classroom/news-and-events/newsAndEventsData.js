On 9th February, under the Wipro Earthian program, 25 students from Col Brown Cambridge School along with their teachers, were taken for birding at Asan Barrage by Nature Science Initiative (NSI). The students spotted migratory birds such as the Red Crested Pochard, Tufted Duck, Common Pochard, Ruddy Shelduck, Eurasian Coot among other species.</p>
  
          <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The NSI team explained to the students why birds migrate, the role of wetlands as important bird habitats and how to conserve them. The students were encouraged to document the birds seen and make checklists. Through such engagements students learn about local biodiversity and nature based careers.</p>
  
          <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Dr. Soumya Prasad and Riddhima Karwa from NSI were resource persons for the sessions. Dr.Shruti Sharma, senior IFS was also present. She gave her valuable inputs to the students and sensitized them on issues like wildlife conservation. It was an enriching experience for the boys.</p>
